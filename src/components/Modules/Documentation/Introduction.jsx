                        <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>Rootz shadows most of the functionalities and provides access to only those which are required for handling the state. This makes it easier for the user to rapidly build complex applications with lesser Lines Of Code <i>(LOC)</i>. Rootz smartly skips the boilerplates code by predefining them during the creation of <SelfLink name="Nodes" route="/nodes" id="create-a-node" />, which otherwise the user may end up writing. This increases the LOC to the functionality ratio without compromising the code quality and complexity. </Typography>
                        <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>It follows a  <Link name="structural-functional" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_functionalism" /> paradigm, which sees your application as a set of Nodes interconnected through definitive set of actions, defined during the application building process. Each action defines the change of state of the Node. All the Nodes abide by these actions resulting into expected application's behavior.</Typography>
                        <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>This makes it easy to manage the state of your application. Rootz is just over <Link name="2kb" url="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rootzjs/core" />, including dependencies.
